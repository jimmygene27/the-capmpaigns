So this was our first meeting.
We just sort of banged around a few ideas.
The one thing that we resolved is that the structure has to be ascertained at the beginning of the book.
We know that we want to section the book into four 15000 words sections.
We know that we want a 2000 word introduction that gives our general thesis and we know that we want a 2000 word after word that concludes our thesis and proves out our point.
We debated endlessly about the specificity of events as being the delimiter of the four sections of the book,
or whether we go strictly with a time delimited structure the structure must be symmetrical for this enterprise to work.
Repetition is the key to getting information into people's heads.
They call it psychic driving in the programs.
I'm not against either structure.
I could go with an event-driven structure when we talk about a certain day in 1969 and a certain part of San Francisco,
describe the weather and everything that happened that day,
and kind of Forrest Gump the narrative out into the three to five years preceding it and what's being set up for the future.
Or we could just chronologically go through a period of time.
This is the critical decision before us right now.
